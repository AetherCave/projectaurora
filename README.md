Hi-Res Audio in Google Pixel 3/XL

## What is this about?
I want to research and make the Pixel 3/XL to output Hi-Res audio using hardware acceleration instead of software acceleration.
The Qualcomm Snapdragon SM845 has a DAC in its interior that can output Hi-Res 32-bit/384kHz audio and has Native DSD capabilites.

## Qualcomm Aqstic Technology
The Qualcomm Snapdragon SM845 comes with Qualcomm Aqstic Audio, which means it can handle Hi-Res PCM up to 32-bit/384kHz and Native DSD up to DSD512.

## Android music players that support HW acceleration
The list is short and more players will be available here

## Where do I get lossless music from?
I don't promote ilegal music download. You can rip your **original** music CDs, this contain lossless 16-bit/44.1kHz.
If you have a SACD, you can rip it with your PC and you will get an .iso file that you can play directly or you can extract the DSD files.
You can go [here](https://www.nativedsd.com/product/ndsd017-nativedsd-music-free-starter-pack/) to get the Native DSD Free pack.

## Disclaimer
This was only tested in Android 13 with a custom ROM, not tested on Stock ROM and is only confirmed to be functional on Android 13 (XDroid ROM).
